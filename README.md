# Badgerloop Website Development

To get started, simply find the button that says *Clone or download*  
and click *Download ZIP*. Unzip the folder and begin editing `index.html`  
between `<!-- YOUR CONTENT BEGIN -->` and `<!-- YOUR CONTENT END -->`.  

It's that simple!

## Files

Important files are `main.css` where you can add your own styling and  
`page.js` where you can utilize [Angular.js](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide) and your own Javascript to  
incorporate some functionality that requires programming. If you would like  
to learn Angular, I would suggest [this free course](https://www.codeschool.com/pages/angular-1-vs-2).

If you want to see how the navbar and footer were made, check out the files in the [js](js) folder.

## Design

For fancy design elements check out [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/1.1.1/), which will also be  
available to you! Definitely check out the **DEMOS** section.

You can add your own CSS styling to [main.css](main.css), or do it within [index.html](index.html).
