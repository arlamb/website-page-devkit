# Badgerloop Website Development

To get started, simply find the button that says *"Clone or download"*  
and click *"Download ZIP"*. Unzip the folder and begin editing `index.html`  
between `<!-- YOUR CONTENT BEGIN -->` and `<!-- YOUR CONTENT END -->`.  

It's that simple!

Other important files are `main.css` where you can add your own styling and  
`page.js` where you can utilize [Angular.js](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide) and your own Javascript to  
incorporate some functionality that requires programming. If you would like  
to learn Angular, I would suggest [this free course](https://www.codeschool.com/pages/angular-1-vs-2).

For fancy design elements check out [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/1.1.1/), which will also be  
available to you! Definitely check out the **DEMOS** section.
